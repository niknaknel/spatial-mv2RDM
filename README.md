# Spatial m-v2RDM
This repository contains code relating to my Master's thesis.

The full implementation can be found in the `src` folder.

## Example usage
The `notebooks/example.ipynb` file contains some examples on how
to run the spatial m-v2RDM for H$_2$ and H$_4$.

## Mappings demo
The `notebooks/mappings-demo.ipynb` file demonstrates the correctness of the
Q and G mappings in `src/dqg.py`, i.e. the $N$-representability conditions used
to constrain the SDP.
